# Automated ETL Pipeline with Control-M Integration

Enterprise data integration solution that eliminates manual data loading processes through comprehensive automation using Control-M, SSIS, and DevOps practices.

## Problem Statement

Manual data loading processes were causing significant operational challenges:
- Daily processing delays affecting critical business reporting
- Data integrity issues from human error
- Resource-intensive manual oversight requirements
- Inconsistent processing across six database tables

## Solution Architecture

### High-Level Data Flow
```
Unix File System → Control-M Scheduler → SSIS Packages → SQL Server → Archive System
```

### Technology Stack
- **Orchestration**: Control-M Enterprise Scheduler
- **ETL Processing**: SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
- **Database**: SQL Server 2019
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub
- **CI/CD**: Azure DevOps
- **File Management**: Unix/Linux file systems

## Key Results

- **100% automation** of previously manual processes
- **Zero data integrity issues** since implementation
- **4-hour reduction** in daily processing time
- **99.9% success rate** with minimal operational intervention

## Technical Implementation

### Pipeline Components

#### 1. File Detection & Triggering
- **Automated Monitoring**: Control-M monitors Unix directories for file arrivals
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Pipeline triggers immediately upon file detection
- **Concurrent Processing**: Handles multiple files simultaneously across different tables

#### 2. SSIS Package Architecture
```
Master Package
├── Package 1: Table A Processing
│   ├── File Validation
│   ├── Table Truncation
│   ├── Data Loading
│   ├── Error Handling
│   └── File Archiving
├── Package 2: Table B Processing
│   └── [Similar pattern]
└── [Packages 3-6 following same structure]
```

#### Key Design Patterns
- **Truncate-and-Load Strategy**: Ensures data consistency
- **Loop-Based Processing**: Dynamic multi-file handling with For-Each containers
- **Atomic Transactions**: Rollback capability for failed operations

#### 3. Error Handling & Data Quality
- **Pre-processing Validation**: Schema and data type verification
- **Transaction Management**: Automatic rollback on failures
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Audit trails and troubleshooting support
- **Dead Letter Processing**: Failed files isolated for investigation

### Control-M Job Flow Configuration

```yaml
# Conceptual job flow structure
File_Arrival_Monitor:
  - Monitor: /data/input/directory
  - Trigger: ON FILE_ARRIVAL
  - Dependencies: Previous day completion

SSIS_Package_Execution:
  - Package: Master_ETL_Package.dtsx
  - Parameters: 
    - SourcePath: /data/input/
    - ArchivePath: /data/archive/
  - On_Success: Archive_Files
  - On_Failure: Error_Notification

Archive_Process:
  - Move files to archive directory
  - Update processing logs
  - Send completion notification
```

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Development (Weeks 1-2)
**Requirements Analysis**
- Mapped 6 source files to target database tables
- Defined data validation rules and business logic
- Established error handling requirements

**SSIS Package Development**
- Created modular package structure (1 master + 6 sub-packages)
- Implemented dynamic file path handling
- Built comprehensive error handling

### Phase 2: DevOps Integration (Week 3)
**Version Control Implementation**
- Git repository with feature branch workflow
- Code review processes
- Environment-specific deployment scripts

**CI/CD Pipeline**
```yaml
# Pipeline stages (conceptual)
stages:
  - validate_ssis_packages
  - deploy_to_dev
  - run_integration_tests
  - deploy_to_uat
  - production_approval_gate
  - deploy_to_production
```

### Phase 3: Testing & Deployment (Week 4)
- Comprehensive testing across Dev/UAT environments
- Parallel production validation
- Go-live monitoring and support
