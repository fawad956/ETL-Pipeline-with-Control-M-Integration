##Automated ETL Pipeline with Control-M Integration
##Enterprise Data Integration Solution

Project Overview
Challenge: Manual data loading processes were causing delays and inconsistencies in critical business reporting systems. Multiple data files needed to be processed daily across six different database tables with strict data integrity requirements.

Solution: Designed and implemented an end-to-end automated ETL pipeline using Control-M, SSIS, and DevOps practices to eliminate manual intervention and ensure reliable data processing.

Impact:

    100% automation of previously manual data loading process
    Zero data integrity issues since implementation
    4-hour reduction in daily processing time
    Seamless integration with existing enterprise scheduling systems

Technical Architecture
Pipeline Components

Unix File System → Control-M Scheduler → SSIS Packages → SQL Server → Archive System

Technology Stack
    Orchestration: Control-M Enterprise Scheduler
    ETL Processing: SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
    Database: SQL Server 2019
    Version Control: Git/GitHub
    CI/CD: Azure DevOps
    File Management: Unix/Linux file systems

Solution Design
1. File Detection & Triggering
    Control-M Flow Configuration: Automated file arrival monitoring in Unix directories
    Event-Driven Processing: Pipeline triggers immediately upon file detection
    Multiple File Support: Handles concurrent file processing for different tables
2. SSIS Package Architecture
For Each Table (6 iterations):
├── File Validation
├── Table Truncation
├── Data Loading
├── Error Handling
└── File Archiving
Key Design Patterns:

    Truncate-and-Load Strategy: Ensures data consistency by clearing target tables before new data insertion
    Loop-Based Processing: Dynamic handling of multiple files per table using For-Each Loop containers
    Atomic Transactions: Each table loading operation wrapped in transactions for rollback capability
3. Error Handling & Data Quality
    File Validation: Schema and data type verification before processing
    Transaction Management: Automatic rollback on failure
    Logging & Monitoring: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting and audit trails
    Dead Letter Processing: Failed files moved to error directory for investigation

Implementation Workflow

Phase 2: DevOps Integration (Week 3)
    Version Control Setup

        Structured Git repository with proper branching strategy
        Implemented code review processes
        Created deployment scripts for different environments

    CI/CD Pipeline Creation

Phase 3: Testing & Deployment (Week 4)
    Non-Production Testing

        Unit testing of individual SSIS components
        Integration testing with Control-M scheduling
        End-to-end testing with sample data files

    Production Deployment

        Coordinated deployment during maintenance window
        Parallel run with legacy system for validation
        Go-live monitoring and support
